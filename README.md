# TerminalGameUE4
## This is my first UE4 Project. Its based on the tutorial(but I just took the idea and the starter project with created scene and implemented terminal logic myself)
#### So its super easy game to get going with Unreal specifics and smooth transition from Unity. Basically its a terminal word guessing game where you receive "bull points" for guessing the letter and position and "cow points" for guessing a letter but in the wrong position. Also you have lives based on word length and when you run out of them you lose.
